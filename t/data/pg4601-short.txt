Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

PAPA HAMLET

von Arno Holz/Johannes Schlaf

1889





I




Was? Das war Niels Thienwiebel? Niels Thienwiebel, der groáe,
unbertroffene Hamlet aus Trondhjem? Ich esse Luft und werde mit
Versprechungen gestopft? Man kann Kapaunen nicht besser msten?...

"He! Horatio!"

"Gleich! Gleich, Nielchen! Wo brennt's denn? Soll ich auch die
Skatkarten mitbringen?"

"N...nein! Das heiát..."

--"Donnerwetter noch mal! Das, das ist ja eine, eine--Badewanne!"

[...]

Der kleine Fortinbras jappte!

Sein Kpfchen hatte sich ihm hinten ins Genick gekrampft, er bohrte
es jetzt verzweifelt nach allen Seiten.

"Na? Willst du nu, oder nich?!--- Bestie!!"

"Aber--Niels! Um Gottes willen! Er hat ja wieder den--Anfall!"

"Ach was! Anfall!--- Da! Friá!!"

"Herrgott, Niels..."

"Friá!!!"

"Niels!"

"Na? Bist du--nu still? Na?--Bist du--nu still?  Na?! Na?! "

"Ach Gott! Ach Gott, Niels, was, was--machst du denn bloá?! Er,
er--schreit ja gar nicht mehr! Er...Niels!!"

Sie war unwillkrlich zurckgeprallt. Seine ganze Gestalt war
vornber geduckt, seine knackenden Finger hatten sich krumm in den
Korbrand gekrallt.  Er stierte sie an. Sein Gesicht war aschfahl.

"Die... L-ampe! Die...L-ampe! Die...L-ampe!"

"Niels!!!"

Sie war rcklings vor ihm gegen die Wand getaumelt.

"Still! Still!! K--lopft da nicht wer?"

Ihre beiden Hnde hinten hatten sich platt ber die Tapete gespreizt,
ihre Knie schlotterten.

"K--lopft da nicht wer?"

Er hatte sich jetzt noch tiefer geduckt. Sein Schatten ber ihm
pendelte, seine Augen sahen jetzt pltzlich weiá aus.

Eine Diele knackte, das l knisterte, drauáen auf die Dachrinne
tropfte das Tauwetter.

Acht Tage spter balancierte der kleine, buckelige Bckerjunge
Tille Topperholt seinen Semmelkorb pfeifend durch das dunkle,
dichtverschneite Severingáchen nach dem Hafen runter. Die Witterung
hatte wieder umgeschlagen, seine kleine Stupsnase sah zum Erbarmen
blau aus.

"Heil dir, Svea! Mutter fr uns alle!"

Es hatte gerade fnf geschlagen. Vor dem neuen, groáen Schnapsladen
an der Ecke der Petrikirche stolperte er. Jesus! Seine Semmeln
waren ihm in den Rinnstein geflogen, er war mitten in den Schnee
geschlagen, Aber er nahm sich nicht einmal die Zeit, sie wieder
aufzulesen. Er kam erst wieder zur Besinnung, als er sich bereits
drben am Jakobiplatz mit beiden Hnden an die groáe, dick beeiste
Glocke gehngt hatte, die denn auch sofort oben die ganze Polizeiwache
alarmierte. Jesus! Jesus!!

Als der dicke Sieversen dann endlich angestapft kam, konstatierte
er, daá der Mann erfroren war.  "Erfroren durch Suff!" Seinen
zerbeulten Zylinder hatte ihm der kleine, buckelige Tille vorhin
grade gegen die Laterne gequetscht. Aus seinen zerlumpten, apfelgrnen
Frackscháen sah noch die Flasche.

Wohlan, eine pathetische Rede!

Es war der groáe Thienwiebel.

Und seine Seele? Seine Seele, die ein unsterblich Ding war?

Lirumn, Larum! Das Leben ist brutal, Amalie!  Verlaá dich
drauf! Aber--es war ja alles egal! So oder so!

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/eBook03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/eBook03

Or /eBook02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE

receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it

such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT

the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
